                     published in <emph rend="italic">Poems</emph> (1794), pp. 37-48, and performed
                     in Dumfries in January, 1794; subsequent performances in Charleston include
                     March 12, 1796 and May 30, 1807. Turnbull regularly included the play in the
                     program for his benefit nights. He and his wife played the leading roles as
                     Sampson and Nell, the argumentative husband and his equally argumentative wife.
                     Though the play’s opening draws its humour from marital conflict, threatened
                     domestic violence, and gender stereotyping, the wife gives as good as she gets:
                     when Sampson threatens to leave her and join the army, she initially tells him
                     to go, as he’s worthless anyway. The denouement of the play, when Nell wants
                     him back, might seem a triumph for Sampson, but to get his release from the
                     army and return to Nell Sampson has to accept his daughter Olly’s wish to marry
                     the Sergeant, which he had previously refused. Sampson fits the stereotype of
                     the village shoemaker or cobbler, as a self-employed and independently-minded
                     craftsman who (to the resentment of his wife) worked intermittently and took
                     time off to go drinking with friends; he also fits the shoemaker stereotype in
                     bring physically small, by contrast with the recruiting sergeant and his the
                     drummer. (Since there is no surviving portrait of Turnbull, this is the only
                     clue there is to his own physical appearance.) The language in the play, though
                     sometimes typographically vernacular, is easy enough to follow when it is acted
                     or read aloud. The annotations here focus less on glossing words than on
                     background, allusions or situations that might be missed in reading.

                        rend="super">2</emph> One of the few ways for a man to make a clean break
                     from Scottish rural or small-town life was to join the army, and for those with
                     no other recourse enlistment became a traditional if drastic escape route from
                     sexual, marital, financial and legal difficulties. Cf. Song IV. Unlike the
                     navy, which sent press-gangs ashore to seize men to become seamen, the army
                     relied on volunteers, sending a recruiting sergeant with a few soldiers (here
                     just a drummer) to country towns and villages, who drink with likely recruits,
                     whose acceptance of a small enlistment payment, “the King’s shilling,” usually
                     spent in celebration with the sergeant, constituted an irrevocable commitment.
