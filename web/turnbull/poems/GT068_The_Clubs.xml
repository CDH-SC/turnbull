                     SC] (March 15, 1796). Robert Crawford has recently contrasted Turnbull’s
                     conclusion here that he will “gladly sing / That loyal song ‘GOD SAVE THE
                     KING!,” with the political ambiguity of Burns’s conclusion to his song “The
                     Dumfries Volunteers," that “While we sing God save the King, / We’ll ne’er
                     forget the People!” (Crawford, <emph rend="italic">The Bard</emph> [Princeton:
                     Princeton University Press, 2009], p. 385; <emph rend="italic">Poems and

                     III: 1469). In December 1792, a riot had broken out in the Dumfries Theatre
                     when radicals in the audience called for singing the French revolutionary song
                     “Ça ira,” while hissing “God save the King”: see <emph rend="italic">Letters of
                        Robert Burns</emph>, ed. G. Ross Roy, 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1985), II:
