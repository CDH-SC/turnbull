                  comedy <emph rend="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</emph> was a staple of late
                  eighteenth-century Scottish theatre; Turnbull’s prologue was written for the
                  Dumfries Theatre. While the play was well-known to American readers, it had never
                  been staged in Charleston before the performance at the City Theatre, on April 30,
                  1796, “under the Sanction and Patronage of the R.W. Grand Lodge of South Carolina
                  Ancient York Masons,” when Turnbull played Bauldy and his wife played
                  Mause.</note></title></head>
