               <p>[In the month of June 1792, an uncommon rumour was spread around Edinburgh, of Mad
                  Dogs. and of people being bit by them—A reward of one shilling for the head of
                  every dog that was killed, was offered; tempted by which, many idle and cruel
                  people took upon them the trade of Dog-killing.—Influenced by the example of the
                  magistrates of the metropolis, the same measures were adopted by many of the
                  inferior towns in Scotland, and many thousands of these faithful animals suffered,
                  though innocent, and far from the contagion, if any such was then in existence. We
                  shall suppose one of them at the place of execution, pleading his own cause, and
                  enveighing against his persecutors.]</p>

                        of England, Scotland and Ireland, William III, is among the oldest in
                        Scotland and stood in Trongate until 1897 after which time it was moved to
                        Glasgow Cross railway station; today it stands in Cathedral Square. </note>
